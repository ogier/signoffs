Randomized Signoffs
===================

This is fun if you want to spit out little quirky signoffs while composing
messages.

1. Drag this link to your bookmarks bar: [Signoff][1]
2. While composing a message in a text input, click the bookmarklet to
    signoff wherever your cursor. Repeatedly clicking will randomly select
    signoffs.

The signoffs mostly came from [Wikipedia][2].
