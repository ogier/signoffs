Randomized Signoffs
===================

This is fun if you want to spit out little quirky signoffs while composing
messages. The message is chosen randomly from a large collection of signoffs,
taken mostly from [this Wikipedia page][2].

1. Drag this link to your bookmarks bar: [Signoff][1].
2. While composing a message, click the bookmarklet.
3. If you don't like the message, or it is totally inappropriate for your boss
    or whatever, click it again.

You can edit the name that gets used by tweaking the bookmark.

Note: The bookmarklet works with GMail, but only in the plain text editing mode.
Patches welcome.
