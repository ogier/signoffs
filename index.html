<h1>Randomized Signoffs</h1>
<p>This is fun if you want to spit out little quirky signoffs while composing
messages.</p>
<ol>
<li>Drag this link to your bookmarks bar: <a href="javascript:(function(){var name='Alex Ogier',f='https://raw.github.com/ogier/signoffs/gh-pages/signoffs.js',d=document.getElementById('canvas-frame').contentDocument||document,j=d.getElementById('__signoffs_js');if(j){randomize_signoff();}else{j=d.createElement('script');j.setAttribute('data-name',name);j.id='__signoffs_js';j.src=f;d.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].appendChild(j);}})();">Signoff</a>.</li>
<li>While composing a message in a text input, click the bookmarklet to
    signoff wherever your cursor. Repeatedly clicking will randomly select
    signoffs.</li>
</ol>
<p>The signoffs mostly came from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parting_phrase">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
